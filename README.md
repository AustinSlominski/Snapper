# jit-hausu
Jitter collection for live performance using video clips, glsl shaders, and opengl graphics.

My hope with this project is to create a useable modular video kit for my own shows. So far the focus has been on manipulating found video clips, but I'm going to begin adding more openGL components.

Works best with OSX. Sometimes shader issues will arise when going back and forth between Windows and OSX. Easy to fix but inconvenient.

My usual setup has been a 2012 Macbook Pro, a Korg Nanokontrol2, and a Korg nanokey2, so that's what the current MIDI bindings are set up for.

## components

Each component of the kit needs to follow some kind of standard format.

TODO: Create a template file for component pieces.

### generators/controllers

Not really the right word for it, but there are a few components that will push out material. Generators.
So that might be for source material, OR some kind of effects map.

### to build

voronoi generator

perlin generator

geometric generator

color generator

video controller

3D controller
