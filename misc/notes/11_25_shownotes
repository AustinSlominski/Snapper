This show went well. Definitely better than the Addison Groove show. Source material makes a huge huge huge difference,
and whether or not I get tired of my material is determined by it. It works well for as long as I'm entertained, after that, I feel like the quality plummets. Each new effect will add some distance to my source material, but I should always
be on the lookout for some source. I'm relatively picky about source material though... the thing is that quality can't be mixed, you can't have low res and hi-res, amateur shot and pro shot, it needs that continuity and consistency. I want to 
try playing around with vhs rips, some alpha masking, etc.

Things I want to improve:

Bugs with the xfadeMess control
Fine tune the color scaling
Get title cards working (should actually be a priority)
Really dig into the GL shaders, get some audio reactive stuff
Get some purely generative, digital visuals. Have some stuff that breaks away from video source material.
Record some of my own video source material...

GL shaders are going to be a big jump in understanding, and potential. If I can implement some interesting 3D visuals for some sets, interesting and well thought out playlists for others, I would be well off. The playlister I built should work well for me, it'll help me figure out exactly what to use and the order. Maybe add a crossfader in there, so I can test overlays...
